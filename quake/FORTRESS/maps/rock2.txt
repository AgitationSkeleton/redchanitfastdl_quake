**** This map designed for the TeamFortress v2.8 quakeC mod **** 
 (it may work fine on lower versions)

5/18/98- Wow, exactly one year from rock1 release.

======================= Installation ======================== 

-rock2.txt
    You are reading it now.
-rock2.bsp
    The map file. Place it with your other Team Fortress maps.
-nerve1.mdl
-mask1.mdl
    Place them in your fortress/progs folder
-rock2.ent
    So server ops can easily change what they want, and mapmakers can see
    how it was done.  Change what you want, then put qbsp.exe(whatever one
    you want to use), rock2.bsp, and rock2.ent in the same folder and run
    qbsp.exe -onlyents rock2.ent rock2.bsp.
    Mapmakers, you can do whatever you want to this ent file and your copy
    of rock2, and it will still run fine on servers.

========================= Game Play =========================== 

Get the enemy key from their wardens office, then take it to their gas chamber.
Also, you can shut down light detection and open a back door to gas chamber by
shooting their generator console.  Detpacks and grenades have no effect on console.
The rocks in tunnel can be detpacked or triggered by the Heavy Weapons Guy at
plunger.  Once gas is released, get one of the few gasmasks or jump in the water.

========================= Thanks to ============================ 

Toe_cutter, Captain Action, Captain Lazer, Arch-CE, Sailor Scout for getting
me interested in Rock again and for some good ideas, and PlagueBearer.
Many thanks to Axl for his Spazball page, and hopefully a Rock2 page.
The Nugget for providing servers for rock1.
